                  This web application was developed to streamline the peer review process in educational environments, integrating AI feedback and gamification to improve the quality of reviews.
                </p>
                <p class="service-item-text" style="margin: 5px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
                  I designed and implemented the entire review system using Laravel for backend management, integrating AI for feedback generation and incorporating a points-based gamification system to incentivize quality reviews.
                </p>
                <p class="service-item-text" style="margin: 5px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
                  Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, including backend management with Laravel and AI integration for feedback generation. This project enhanced my skills in both technical implementation and project management.
                </p>
                <p class="service-item-text" style="margin: 5px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
                  As this was an individual assignment, I took on the roles of lead developer and project manager, overseeing full-stack development and integrating AI functionality.
                </p>
                <p class="service-item-text" style="margin: 5px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
                  I learned that effective gamification can greatly enhance user engagement, and AI feedback can significantly improve the quality of peer-to-peer interactions.

                  This project involved developing a live streaming platform integrated with Agora, designed to create interactive shopping experiences through real-time audience engagement and seamless communication.
                </p>
                <p class="service-item-text" style="margin: 5px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
                  As the backend developer, I focused on ensuring reliable data transmission and real-time interactions. The most challenging aspect of the project was integrating the live streaming functionality, which required a deep understanding of both the Agora SDK and real-time communication protocols.

                <p class="service-item-text" style="margin: 5px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
